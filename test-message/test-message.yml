tagline: Assure health of messaging components
desc: Assure health of messaging components by sending test messages. Note: Instead of the original pattern, we have selected a modern version where infrastructure poll for the health of the components.
helps: Ballerina provides built-in support creating, propagating(`check` keyword), and handling errors. Error handling logic can be performed after tested if a given value is an error using `is` keyword.
